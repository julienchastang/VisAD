# VisAD

This is a git mirror of the [VisAD project](http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/visad.html) built by Bill Hibbard and the Space Science and Engineering Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

You may get compilation errors related to not finding Java 3D. In this case, you will have to [install](http://download.java.net/media/java3d/builds/release/1.5.1/README-download.html) Java 3D into your JRE.

NB: In order to get the VisAD project migrated to Maven, I had to prune out the following directories from the original VisAD SVN repo

Jama/<br />
dods/clients/<br />
dods/dap/test/<br />
dods/servers/<br />
dods/servlet/<br />
gnu/regexp/util/<br />
